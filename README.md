## Hi There I'm Oğuzhan👋 
As a graduate of Hacettepe University’s Computer Science Department, I am currently working as a software developer at Technarts. With a passion for both software development and graphic design, I aim to merge these two fields to create innovative and impactful projects.

I thrive in collaborative environments, take responsibility with a strong sense of leadership, and am constantly seeking opportunities to grow my skills while contributing to meaningful projects. ☺️
